# Therapist Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling

## Overview
This project analyzes therapist responses from an online mental health platform.  
It consists of two parts:
- **Sentiment and Tone Classification** using machine learning models.
- **Topic Modeling** to uncover common themes in therapist communication.

## Files
- `sentiment_analysis_directive_responses_project.ipynb`: Sentiment analysis and tone classification.
- `topic_modeling_therapist_responses.ipynb`: Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- `/data/full_dataset_sentiment_directive_responses.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.

## Methods
- Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal.
- Feature Engineering: Sentiment labeling, tone detection.
- Machine Learning: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes.
- Topic Modeling: LDA with Gensim.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the dataset (`data/full_dataset_sentiment_directive_responses.csv`) is in the `/data/` folder.
3. Open the notebooks and run all cells.
